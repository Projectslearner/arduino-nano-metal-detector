# Metal Detector

#### Project Overview

The Metal Detector project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano to create a simple metal detection system. It utilizes a metal detector sensor, typically based on the principle of electromagnetic induction, to detect the presence of metal objects in its vicinity. When a metal object is detected, an LED indicator is activated to provide a visual indication.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Metal Detector Sensor**
3. **Resistors**
4. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Metal Detector Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the analog pin of the metal detector sensor to an analog pin (e.g., A0) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the other terminal of the LED to a current-limiting resistor (optional) and then to ground (GND) of the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the metal detector sensor and LED to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, observe the behavior of the LED.
   - Bring metal objects close to the metal detector sensor and observe the LED activation when metal is detected.
   - Verify metal detection by observing the printed messages in the Serial Monitor.

#### Applications

- **Security Systems:** Use the metal detector for security screening applications in public places such as airports, schools, and events.
- **Treasure Hunting:** Build handheld metal detectors for hobbyists interested in treasure hunting or metal detecting activities.
- **Industrial Applications:** Implement metal detection systems in manufacturing processes to prevent metal contamination in products.

#### Notes

- Adjust the threshold value in the code based on the sensitivity required for metal detection.
- Experiment with different metal detector sensor models and configurations to optimize performance for specific applications.
- Consider incorporating additional features such as audio alarms or data logging for enhanced functionality.
